# Jellyfin LXC at 192.168.178.140. Override jellyfin_media_path if mount differs.
# jellyfin_media_path: /media   # default; must be bind-mounted from Proxmox media-storage
# AdGuard DNS rewrite: media.mol.la -> 192.168.178.140
# Optional: set jellyfin_uid / jellyfin_gid to match media dir owner so nfo/subtitles are created with correct ownership.
